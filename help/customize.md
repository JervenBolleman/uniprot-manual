Searches in the Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), as well as in all other namespaces in the UniProt website, display results either in a card format, or in a tabular format.
In the tabular format you can configure which columns are shown in the result table, and have your selection reflected in the **download** of your data in form of a tab-separated file. You can also use the resulting URL [programmatically](https://www.uniprot.org/help/api).

When you click on "Customize columns" button, accompanied by the pencil icon on its left, which is located right above the results table, you will obtain a panel containing grouped lists of available columns to display. 2 mains groups are separated in 2 tabs, one containing the columns showing data and the other containing columns showing external links to [other resources for which we have cross-references](https://www.uniprot.org/database?query=*). Columns in both tabs are further grouped by categories such as "Names & Taxonomy", "Sequences", or "Function".

The columns currently shown in the table of results have a selected checkbox, and their parent categories show how many of those are selected in each group.

These checkboxes can be toggled on and off, immediately reflecting in the table of results below the panel. This selection is kept in the local memory of your browser and will be saved when you come back to the website in the future. This will also be reset if you clear the website's data, and will not be shared with another browser on your computer, or with another computer that you might also be using.

You can search for specific columns through the text search box at the top of each tab.

At any time, you can reset the selection by clicking the "Reset to default" at the bottom of each page.

Your column selection can be used to produce a **tab-separated output** containing the same set of columns, e.g. for use in a spreadsheet program such as Excel©: Once you are happy with your table layout, click on "Download" and select one of tab-separated or Excel formats.

You once you have customized your view, you can share it to colleagues through the "Share" > "Copy link to your results" functionality. When this copied link is opened in another browser, it will show the exact same view that you were presented with, with the same columns in the same order.
