A proteome is the set of proteins thought to be expressed by an organism.

## Protein count
Number of protein entries associated with a proteome: UniProtKB entries for regular proteomes or UniParc entries for redundant proteomes. There are more information about the redundant proteomes in [Reducing proteome redundancy](https://www.uniprot.org/help/taxonomic_lineage).

## Gene count
This is the total number of unique genes found in the proteome set, algorithmically computed. For each gene, a single representative protein sequence is chosen from the proteome. Where possible, reviewed (Swiss-Prot) protein sequences are chosen as the representatives.

## Genome Assembly
The genome assembly is simply the genome sequence produced after chromosomes have been fragmented, those fragments have been sequenced, and the resulting sequences have been put back together.
