This document explains the HTTP response headers returned by the UniProt REST API
and gives some examples to make explicit what they mean.

# HTTP Status Headers

[HTTP statuses](https://httpstatuses.com/) are standard numeric codes indicating whether a specific HTTP request successfully
completed. In the following sections, we describe all status codes returned by the UniProt REST API.

## 200 OK

The `200 OK` status code indicates the request succeeded. For example:

> **Request**
>
> ```bash
> curl -X GET "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?size=1&query=P53&fields=accession%2Cgene_names" \
>      -H "accept: application/json"
> ```
>
> **Important Response Headers**
>
> ```bash
>  HTTP/1.1 200
>  content-type: application/json
>  link: <https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?fields=accession,gene_names&query=P53&cursor=82giuzutyxve1mc8va46o7i2jq3r7fb5tf&size=1>; rel="next"
>  x-uniprot-release-date: 25-July-2021
>  x-uniprot-release: 2021_03
>  x-total-results: 49524
>  ...
> ```
>
> **Response Body**
>
> ```json
> {
>   "results": [
>     {
>       "primaryAccession": "P04637",
>       "genes": [
>         {
>           "geneName": { "value": "TP53" },
>           "synonyms": [{ "value": "P53" }]
>         }
>       ]
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```

## 303 See Other

The `303 See Other` status code indicates that you are being redirected to another resource via the "Location" response
header.

### UniProtKB inactive entry example:

> **Request**
>
> ```bash
> curl -X GET "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q00015" -H "accept: application/json"
> ```
>
> **Response Headers**
>
> ```bash
>  HTTP/1.1 303
>  content-type: application/json
>  Location: /uniprotkb/P23141?from=Q00015
>  x-uniprot-release-date: 25-July-2021
>  x-uniprot-release: 2021_03
>  ...
> ```

## 400 Bad request

The `400 Bad request` status code indicates that the server was unable to process the request due to invalid information
sent by the client. In other words, the client request needs modification.

The following two subsections give examples of bad requests:

### Missing required request parameter

> **Request**
>
> ```bash
> curl -X GET "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search" -H "accept: application/json"
> ```
>
> **Response**
>
> ```json
> {
>   "url": "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search",
>   "messages": ["'query' is a required parameter"]
> }
> ```

### Invalid parameter value

> **Request**
>
> ```bash
> curl -X GET "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?query=invalidQueryField%3Avalue+AND+accession%3AinvalidValue&fields=invalidField" -H "accept: application/json"
> ```
>
> **Response**
>
> ```json
> {
>   "url": "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search",
>   "messages": [
>     "'invalidQueryField' is not a valid search field",
>     "The 'accession' filter value 'invalidValue' has invalid format. It should be a valid UniProtKB accession",
>     "Invalid fields parameter value 'invalidField'"
>   ]
> }
> ```

## 404 Resource not found

The `404 Resource not found` status code indicates the server was unable to find the resource that was requested. For
example:

> **Request**
>
> ```bash
> curl -X GET "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/accession/P99997" -H "accept: application/json"
> ```
>
> **Response**
>
> ```json
> {
>   "url": "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/accession/P99997",
>   "messages": ["Resource not found"]
> }
> ```

## 500 Internal server error

The `500 Internal server error` status code indicates that the processing of the request on the server failed unexpectedly.
If you are able to replicate this error consistently, please report it to us through our [contact page](https://www.uniprot.org/contact).

# x-uniprot-release-date

This response header indicates the last date that the API was updated. Refer to, [200 OK above](#200-ok), to see an example
of its generation.

> ```bash
> x-uniprot-release-date: 25-July-2021
> ```

# x-uniprot-release

This response header indicates the current UniProt data release number.

> ```bash
> x-uniprot-release: 2021_03
> ```

# x-total-results

This response header indicates the number of entities found in your search. See more details in the [Paginating results](https://www.uniprot.org/help/pagination)
help page.

# link

This response header indicates the URL link to the next page of entities. See more details in the [Paginating results](https://www.uniprot.org/help/pagination)
help page.

> ```bash
> link: <https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?query=P53&cursor=1mkycb2xwxbou9vfxnpy5g9gjf6k5i9fxg6s&size=25>; rel="next"
