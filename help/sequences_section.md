This section displays by default the canonical protein sequence and upon request all isoforms described in the entry. It also includes information pertinent to the sequence(s), including [length](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_length) and [molecular weight](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences). The information is filed in different subsections. The current subsections and their content are listed below:
