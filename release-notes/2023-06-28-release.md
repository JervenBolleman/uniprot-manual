## The fair price of an (ant) lunch

Ants live everywhere, on all continents except Antarctica, and they represent the largest number of individual organisms on our planet. Their abundance and nutritional value make them an interesting source of food for many different birds, spiders, mammals, lizards, toads, etc. Some animals feed opportunistically on solitary workers, but others attack colonies to feed on the brood (eggs, larvae, and pupae) and hence could represent a threat for ant species survival. This is the case for giant (15-30 mm body length) red bull ants ([_Myrmecia gulosa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmecia_gulosa)), whose colonies seem to be particularly appreciated by the Australian short-beaked echidna ([_Tachyglossus aculeatus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-beaked_echidna)), an ant-eating monotreme.

Like most ants, giant red bull ants are venomous and can cause extremely painful reactions that last for days. Their [venom contains amphipathic peptides, called aculeatoxins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30214940/), that are capable of activating mammalian sensory neurons, and also a unique cysteine-rich peptide called [MIITX2-Mg1a](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0DSL4/entry) (or Mg1a), which is unrelated to the aculeatoxins and whose [function was unknown until recently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35131940/). Mg1a is the major component of _M. gulosa_ venom. It is predicted to adopt an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like fold and sequence analysis revealed high sequence similarity to EGF-like peptides. Surprisingly the highest similarity scores were not obtained for insect EGF-like hormones, but for marsupial ones, suggesting that the natural target of Mg1a is not the endogenous EGF receptor (EGFR) but a vertebrate one, possibly that of a mammalian predator. When tested in human cells, Mg1a appeared to be a potent ligand of EGFR with an activity comparable to that of human EGF. Mg1a presence in the venom of _M. gulosa_ may reflect its evolution as a defensive weapon, but then what effect could it have on a vertebrate predator? Shallow intraplantar injection of Mg1a in mice did not cause spontaneous nocifensive behavior, but 2 to 4 hours after injection mice developed hypersensitivity, showing a decreased threshold in paw-withdrawal in response to both mechanical and thermal stimuli. This effect lasted several days. The advantages for the ants of such a delayed effect are not obvious. Possibly the long-lasting hypersensitivity may reduce the duration of the attack, discourage future attacks, or enhance the algesic actions of subsequent exposure to other pain-causing venom peptides.

This is not the first example of biological mimicry, where one organism gains a selective advantage by mimicking an aspect of another organism. [Cone snails mimic fish insulin in their venom gland](https://www.uniprot.org/release-notes/2017-04-12-release). When hunting, they release venom insulin, causing hypoglycemia and consequently knockdown of their prey, facilitating their capture. However, there is more to this study than just a very elegant discovery of convergent evolution. It also shows the importance of EGFR signaling in mammalian pain, an aspect of EGF function that previously had not receive much attention. EGF is mostly known for its role in wound healing. Following an injury, high concentrations of EGF are released at the wound site where they serve a critical role in wound healing, but they may also sensitize sensory neurons innervating the site of injury. The resulting hypersensitivity may ensure its protection during the healing process. In a very different setting, the involvement of EGF in pain has also been observed. EGFR inhibitors, such as [erlotinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlotinib), are used in anti-cancer therapy to slow tumor growth. In this context, clinical trials reported that a significant proportion of patients [experienced pain relief following treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34054523/). We are still far from the production of new generation pain killers, but by unveiling a new signaling pathway in pain, this study paves the way for future drug developments.

As of this release, the newly annotated [Mg1a](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0DSL4/entry) toxin is publicly available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

## New UniProtKB download format: h5 for embeddings

We added a new download option called ‘Embeddings’ for UniProtKB entries as per-protein embeddings in the HDF5 format.
It is available for UniProtKB search results and will generate an [asynchronous download file generation job](https://www.uniprot.org/help/file-generation-download).
