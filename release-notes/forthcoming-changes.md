# Change of evidence code for the [ProtNLM](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ProtNLM) method

**On September 6th, 2023**

The April 2023 release of the [ECO ontology](https://evidenceontology.org/about_eco/) introduced several new terms, including [ECO:0008006](https://ontobee.org/ontology/ECO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0008006) - "deep learning method evidence used in automatic assertion". This ECO term accurately describes the ProtNLM method, and we will therefore replace the currently used [ECO:0000256](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0000256) by [ECO:0008006](https://ontobee.org/ontology/ECO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0008006) for predictions generated by the [ProtNLM](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ProtNLM) method in UniProt release 2023_04.
