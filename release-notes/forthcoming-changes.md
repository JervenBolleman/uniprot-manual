# Change of evidence code for [ProtNLM](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ProtNLM) method

**On September 6th, 2023**

With recent changes in ECO ontology, new terms were added in the April, 2023 release which includes [ECO:0008006](https://ontobee.org/ontology/ECO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0008006) - “deep learning method evidence used in automatic assertion”. This ECO code accurately describes the ProtNLM method and therefore from UniProt v2023_04, we will be replacing [ECO:0000256](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0000256) by [ECO:0008006](https://ontobee.org/ontology/ECO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_0008006) for predictions generated by [ProtNLM](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ProtNLM) method.
